Our feature is a form for reviewers to enter and score candidates along various catergories/fields. We did not have time to implement the backend to save and collect the form data from multiple reviewers due to time constraints.

+ The fields we chose were
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email Address
    * Experience Score
    * Skills Score
    * GPA
    * Essay Score
    * Additional Comments
    * Final Decision
    * Name of Reviewer

## Reasoning for chosing those fields
+ First and Last Name
    - This is clearly needed to distinguish each candidate
+ Email Address
    - To be able to contact the candidate if needed
+ Experience Score
    - This is an important field for graduate schools to see what the applicant has done for research/extracurriculars
+ Skills Score
    - If the candidate has any special skills that seperates them from others
+ GPA
    - To see how well the candidate has done in education so far
+ Essay Score
    - To see how well each candidate is at communicating their ideas or to understand their background
+ Additional Comments
    - For if the reviewer wants to add information that does not fall under any of the previous categories
+ Final Decision
    - For the reviewer to make a final decision about if the person should be accepted or not
+ Name of Reviewer
    - Putting the reviewer's name will help to keep them accountable
