Our feature is a form for reviewers to enter and score candidates along various catergories/fields. We did not have time to implement the backend to save and collect the form data from multiple reviewers due to time constraints.

+ The fields we chose were
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email Address
    * Experience Score
    * Skills Score
    * GPA Score
    * Essay Score

## Reasoning for chosing these fields
+ First and Last Name
    - This is clearly need to distinguish each candidate
+ Email Address
    - To be able to contact the candidate if needed
+ Experience Score
    - This is an important field for graduate schools to see what the applicant has done
+ Skills Score
    - If the candidate has any special skills that seperates them from others
+ GPA Score
    - To see how well the candidate in education so far
+ Essay Score
    - To see how well each candidate is at communicating their ideas or to understand their background
