- GPA Score: a rating of the candidate's GPA, based on their GPA out of 4.0
- Essay Score: a rating of the candidate's essay from 1 to 5

## Notes

<!-- as of 9/30  -->
- Form fields that are ratings from 1 to 5 mean that 1 represents a poor candidate and 5 represents an exemplary candidate in regards to that field.
- As of now, the backend is not set up for the feature. Therefore, forms will not be saved upon submission. This is planned to be implemented in a later sprint.
- This form is meant to be concise yet holistic evaluation of the candidate, which is why most fields are numbered from 1 to 5. If a reviewer has additional comments or wants to make note of a special case, they may use the "Additional comments" field to do so.
